## Creating the Rules

To get started, you will need to run the command \</règlement créer>. **DraftBot** will then give you the option to **add the role** you want to assign to members, as well as **lock** the role so that members cannot remove it.

Once they have read the rules and clicked the `Accept the rules` button.

## Add rules

Now that the embed has been created, you will need to add rules to maintain good stability in your community.

To do this, you will use the \</reglement ajouter> command. DraftBot will ask you for: the rule message, the title, and the description of your rule.

::hint{ type="warning" }
  For the rule message, you need to retrieve the **ID** of the embed of the rule you created.

::hint{ type="warning" }
  The title is limited to **256** characters, while the description is limited to **1024** characters.

## Modify a rule

You can modify your rules at any time, whether to make a correction or to make them more aesthetic according to your preferences. You will need the \</reglement modifier> command.

The procedure is not very different from the \</reglement ajouter> command, except that a new field appears: `rule`.

This field allows you to select **the rule** you want to modify.

  You can modify the rules from the panel in the [Messages](/dashboard/first/messages) category. The embed is titled **"Server Rules"**.

## Remove a rule

If a rule doesn't suit you and you want to remove it, you can use the command \</reglement retirer>. You will just need to retrieve the **message ID** of the rule and select the **rule**.
